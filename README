GStreamer Complex Variable Transforms
=====================================

Applies mathematical transforms written as functions of complex
variables to video.

Just for rough demos for now.  Includes large chunks of other
gstreamer plugins without proper documentation or naming.

DO NOT install this on a system: just for testing for now!

I'm learning this by looking at other gstreamer plugins so there is a
lot of other people's code here.

TODO: document this.
